    <h1>Power Outage Research</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset I will be looking at is the power outage dataset. It shows
      power outages across the country starting from the year 2000 until 2016.
      Additionally, the dataset shows individual state's economic output. This
      led me to the question: How does a stateâ€™s economic strength influence the
      severity and frequency of power outages? Are states with stronger
      economies better protected against outages, or is their resilience more
      closely tied to geographic and climatic conditions? This question is
      vital, as power outages can have a significant impact on a state's
      economy. If there is a clear correlation between economic strength and
      power outages, states can take steps to improve their infrastructure and
      reduce the impact of outages on their economy. As the economy is an
      important factor in elections and many studies, we can figure out how to
      improve the state's and the country's economy by being more efficient.
      This dataset has a total of 1534 rows and 55 columns. However, we are only
      interested in 15 of them: - Year: To see how the number of outages has
      changed over time and to understand the year by year economic impact. -
      Month: The month can help us figure out the geographical cause and also
      helps us set the economy into perspective. - U.S. State: We are interested
      in looking at the differences between states. - Postal Code: The postal
      codes could also help us figure out if certain communities might
      experience more outages. - NERC Region: NERC regions can help us
      understand the geographical cause of outages. - Climate Region: Climate
      region also shows us if certain regions are more prone to outages. -
      'ANOMALY.LEVEL': This column shows the severity of the outage itself. -
      'CLIMATE.CATEGORY': This will help us understand the corresponding climate
      episodes a state has gone through in that year, to figure out if there is
      a correlation between climate and outages. - 'CAUSE.CATEGORY': This column
      will help us understand the cause of the outages and look at difference
      between states. - 'HURRICANE.NAMES': By knowing the name of the hurrican,
      we can see to what extent states were affected by that hurricane. -
      'OUTAGE.DURATION': Using this, we can look if certain states on average
      have longer outages. - 'TOTAL.SALES': By understanding the total sales, we
      know the general energy demand of a state. - 'TOTAL.CUSTOMERS': This will
      also help us understand the general energy demand of a state. -
      'PC.REALGSP.REL': We can use this column to see how the state's economy is
      doing relative to the national economy. - 'PC.REALGSP.STATE': This will
      help us understand the state's economy in general, which we can compare
      over time.
